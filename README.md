***‧₊˚ ☁️⋅♡𓂃 ࣪ ִֶָ☾。Plot***

Banana Fish is set in the United States in the mid-1980s, primarily in New York City. Seventeen-year-old street gang leader Ash Lynx cares for his older brother Griffin, a Vietnam War veteran who has been in a vegetative state since a combat incident in which he fired on his own squadron and uttered the words "banana fish". One night, Ash witnesses two of his gang members kill a man who instructs Ash to "seek banana fish" before dying. The two gang members tell Ash they were acting on orders from Dino Golzine, the head of the Corsican mafia in New York; Ash was formerly an enforcer and child sex slave to Golzine, having been groomed from a young age to become the eventual heir to his criminal enterprise.

The Banana Fish symbolizes greed. This was pretty obvious in the story. However, the analysis implies Salinger was using the bananafish story to suggest “that people fatten themselves with materialism”. Hmm… The bananafish may also symbolize emotions or the emotional pain felt by Seymour
